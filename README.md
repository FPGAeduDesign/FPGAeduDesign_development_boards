# FPGAeduDesign – HDL Peripheral Experiments

This repository contains a collection of VHDL and Verilog designs created to test, validate, and experiment with the peripherals available on the FPGAeduDesign development boards:

- **Explorer Lite-1k**
- **Explorer Neo-5k**
- **Explorer Edge-9k**

These example projects provide a practical starting point for users who want to understand how to interact with the hardware, learn FPGA development, or quickly prototype new ideas.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide **ready-to-use HDL projects** that demonstrate the functionality of on-board peripherals.  
These designs are suitable for:

- Digital logic learning and experimentation  
- Peripheral testing and debugging  
- Rapid prototyping  
- Embedded system development  
- FPGA education and research  

---

## 🧩 Included Designs

Two complete example projects written in **VHDL and Verilog**, showcasing how to interface with various peripherals, such as:

- LEDs  
- Buttons and switches  
- GPIO  
- UART  
- SPI / I²C  
- Displays (if applicable)  
- Any additional peripherals integrated into the boards  

Each design is structured for clarity, making it easy to modify, extend, or integrate into custom projects.
