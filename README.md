# 🚀 FPGAeduDesign Development Boards  
Modern FPGA platforms for learning, prototyping, and embedded innovation.

Welcome to the official repository for **FPGAeduDesign Development Boards** — a collection of open hardware platforms created to accelerate learning and exploration in **digital design, HDL development, embedded systems, and FPGA-based SoCs**.

This repository includes **schematics, hardware files, documentation, and example projects** for three custom boards:

- **Explorer Lite-1k** — a compact, beginner-friendly FPGA board  
- **Explorer Neo-5k** — a balanced board for intermediate projects  
- **Explorer Edge-9k** — a powerful platform for advanced embedded designs  

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or engineer, these boards help you go from **idea → prototype → functional system**.
